## ‚úÖ Task 1: Create a New Pluggable Database (PDB)

### Steps Performed

1. Connected as `SYSDBA` to the CDB root.
2. Created PDB `le_pdb_26478` with admin user `leon_plsqlauca_26478`.
3. Opened the PDB and saved its state for auto-start on reboot.

### Key Command Used

```sql
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE le_pdb_26478
ADMIN USER leon_plsqlauca_26478 IDENTIFIED BY password123
ROLES = (CONNECT, RESOURCE)
DEFAULT TABLESPACE USERS
DATAFILE 'C:\oracle\oradata\ORCL\le_pdb_26478\le_pdb_26478.dbf'
SIZE 100M AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 10M MAXSIZE UNLIMITED
FILE_NAME_CONVERT = (
    'C:\oracle\oradata\ORCL\pdbseed\', 
    'C:\oracle\oradata\ORCL\le_pdb_26478\'
);

ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE le_pdb_26478 OPEN;
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE le_pdb_26478 SAVE STATE;
```

## ‚úÖ Task 2: Create and Delete a PDB

### Steps Performed

1. Created a temporary PDB named `le_to_delete_pdb_26478`.
2. Verified it was open and registered.
3. Deleted the PDB permanently, including all datafiles.

### Key Commands Used

```sql
-- Create
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE le_to_delete_pdb_26478
ADMIN USER leon_to_delete_plsqlauca_26478 IDENTIFIED BY password123
ROLES = (CONNECT, RESOURCE)
DEFAULT TABLESPACE USERS
DATAFILE 'C:\oracle\oradata\ORCL\le_to_delete_pdb_26478\le_to_delete_pdb_26478.dbf'
SIZE 100M AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 10M MAXSIZE UNLIMITED
FILE_NAME_CONVERT = (
    'C:\oracle\oradata\ORCL\pdbseed\', 
    'C:\oracle\oradata\ORCL\le_to_delete_pdb_26478\'
);

ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE le_to_delete_pdb_26478 OPEN;

-- Delete
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE le_to_delete_pdb_26478 CLOSE IMMEDIATE;
DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE le_to_delete_pdb_26478 INCLUDING DATAFILES;
```

## ‚úÖ Task 3: Configure Oracle Enterprise Manager (EM) Express

### Steps Performed

1. Enabled EM Express on port `5501` (port `5500` was in use by `tnslsnr.exe`).
2. Granted `DBA` role to `leon_plsqlauca_26478` to allow EM login.
3. Accessed EM Express via browser and logged in with student credentials.

### Key Commands Used

```sql
-- Enable EM Express on port 5501
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = le_pdb_26478;
EXEC DBMS_XDB_CONFIG.SETHTTPSPORT(5501);

-- Grant DBA for EM access (class project only)
GRANT DBA TO leon_plsqlauca_26478 CONTAINER=CURRENT;
```

Access URL: `https://localhost:5501/em`
